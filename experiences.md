### Remote Collaboration <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/caltech.png" alt="Drawing" width="90" height="90" align="right"/>

*California Institute of Technology, Pasadena* \| Aug 2018 – Present<br>
<i>Supervisors: Prof. Anima Anandkumar, Bren Professor, California Institute of Technology<br>
* Attempts to combine the benefits of <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/10-245/10-245.pdf"><u>Bayesian approaches</u></a>, such as targeted exploration and sample efficiency in gradient estimation, with the guaranteed monotonic policy improvements offered by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477"><u>TRPO method</u></a>.<br>
* Extends the work in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04412.pdf"><u>Azizzadenesheli et al., (2018)</u></a> to continuous state-action space.

### Research Intern <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/IITR.jpg" alt="Drawing" width="90" height="90" align="right"/>

*Signal Processing Laboratory, IIT Roorkee* \| Jul 2017 – May 2018<br>
<i>Supervisor: Dr. Vinod Pankajakshan, Assistant Professor, IIT Roorkee</i><br>
* Surveys recent work in the area of single image super resolution (SISR), covering advances in neural network
architectures, learning algorithms, objective functions, and how they all overcome the ill-posed nature of SISR.<br>
* Special emphasis on perceptual loss functions as a better alternative to point estimate objective functions, which
suffer from regression-to-the-mean problem.

### Remote Intern <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/IMSC.png" alt="Drawing" width="90" height="90" align="right"/>

<i>Supervisor: Dr. R Ramanujam, Professor, Theoretical Computer Science, IMSc</i> | Jul 2017 – Jan 2018<br>
* Examined the mathematical principles behind various advanced cryptographic protocols in the zk-SNARK pipeline.

### Analog Design Internship <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/TI.png" alt="Drawing" width="150" height="50" align="right"/>

*Texas Instruments, Bengaluru, India* \| May 2017 – July 2017 <br>
<i>Supervisor: Ankur Kumar Singh, Analog Design Engineer, Texas Instruments</i> <br>
* Worked on automatic generation of Design Verification environment. A python script that would take an xlsx file as input to generate the required test conditions.<br>
* Removes human role (bottleneck) in the verification pipeline, saving significant employee time and effort.

### Research Intern <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/IITR.jpg" alt="Drawing" width="90" height="90" align="right"/>

*Machine Vision Lab, IIT Roorkee* \| January 2016 – May 2016<br>
<i>Supervisor: Dr. R Balasubramanian, Associate Professor, IIT Roorkee</i><br>
* Simulate deduplication in a Cloud-Based System using Convergent Key Management.<br>
* Block level deduplication achieved using SHA-256 (Convergent Key).<br>
* Master Key on local device to prevent “Confirmation of a File Attack”. <br />

### Undergraduate Proficiency <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/aries.jpg" alt="Drawing" width="65" height="65" align="right"/>

*Artificial Intelligence and Electronics Society (ArIES), IIT Roorkee* \| January 2016 – March 2016 <br>
* Induced touch detection using optics(Infrared radiation, total internal reflection and blog detection). <br>
* Simulated Touch Screen device
