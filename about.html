    I am Arunav Pratap Shandeelya, also known as 'vampire'. My interest lies in software security and system programming. I am the author of '<a href="https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/">Heap Exploitation</a>'. I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee</a> in Computer Science recently and will be joining the Master of Science in Information Security program at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a> in the fall of 2017.

    My hobby is software development. I love to create software that creates a big impact on others. I have successfully completed the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> program twice (in 2015 and 2016). I am the creator and maintainer of <a href="https://luarocks.org/modules/dhavalkapil/elasticsearch">elasticsearch-lua</a>, a client for Elasticsearch in Lua, <a href="https://dhavalkapil.com/luaver/">luaver</a>, the Lua Version Manager, and <a href="https://dhavalkapil.com/icmptunnel">icmptunnel</a>, software to tunnel IP traffic over ICMP.

    During my undergraduate days, I was a member of <a href="https://sdslabs.co/">SDSLabs</a>, where I developed and hosted <a href="https://backdoor.sdslabs.co/">Backdoor</a>, an online wargame platform for computer security enthusiasts. I also helped co-found <a href="https://github.com/InfoSecIITR/">InfoSecIITR</a>. I spent first few years participating in various Capture the Flag events and the last year doing an in-depth security analysis of <a href="https://github.com/DhavalKapil/xss-auditor-analysis">XSS Auditor</a>, <a href="https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Attacking-the-OAuth-Protocol/">OAuth 2.0 protocol,</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DhavalKapil/arp-analysis">Address Resolution Protocol</a>. I found an information disclosure vulnerability in XSS-Auditor and Google credited me with <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html">CVE-2017-5045</a>.

    I spend my free time reading novels (preferably fiction) and playing the piano.
